              DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 with Relay Agent Support
             draft-porfiri-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6-ra-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a general mechanism for networks with legacy
   IPv4 only clients to use DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) for
   discovering information about network Topology.  To address this
   scenario, this document specifies an amendment to RFC7341 that allows
   a new 4o6 Relay Agent (4o6RA) to perform the 4o6 DHCP en- and
   decapsultion instead of the client.

1.  Introduction

   In some networks the configuration of a client host may depend on the
   Topology.  However, when a new client host gets connected to the
   network, it may be unaware of the Topology and respectively how it
   has to be configured.

   In IPv6 networks, Topology discover can be realized using DHCPv6
   Relay Agents [RFC6221] that insert relay agent options in DHCPv6
   message exchanges in order to identify the client-facing interfaces,
   e.g. using the Serial Number or other hardcoded information.  Then, a
   reference host that is responsible for providing configuration to the
   client host can obtain Topology information from the DHCP server.

   In DHCPv6, a Relay Agent can encapsulate the DHCP message from the
   client in a new DHCP message along with any options it chooses to add
   to provide information to the DHCP server.  This mode of operation
   also supports networks that include a hierarchy of switches.

   However, if the client only supports IPv4 and cannot easily be
   replaced or updated, this approach does not work, as DHCPv4 support
   for relays is much more limited.  For instance, there is no support
   in DHCPv4 for hierarchical modes of deployment, as the specifications
   prohibit chaining of Relay Agent Information Options (RAIOs)
   [RFC3046].

   A typical example where Topology Discovery is needed for host
   configuration is the switched fronthaul in the Radio Access Network
   (see Section 3).  However, the specified approach in this document is
   not limited to that example.

   This document specifies how to provide Topology Discover using Relay
   Agent functionality for legacy IPv4 clients using DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6
   (DHCP 4o6) [RFC7341].  No new protocols or extensions are needed,
   instead this document specifies an amendment to [RFC7341] that allows
   a Relay Agent to perform the 4o6 DHCP en- and decapsultion instead of
   the client in order to address the specific scenario that is detailed
   in Section 4.2.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The following terms and acronyms are used in this document:

   *  4o6 The architecture, the procedures and the protocols described
      in the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 document [RFC7341].

   *  4o6RA The 4o6 Relay Agent is the part of an LDRA implementing 4o6

   *  DHCP Relay Agent

      This is a concept in all of the protocols, BOOTP [RFC0951]
      [RFC1542], DHCPv4 [RFC2131] [RFC2132], and DHCPv6 [RFC8415],
      although the details differ between the protocols.

   *  Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (LDRA)

      This is an extension of the original DHCPv6 Relay Agent mechanism,
      to support also Layer 2 devices performing a Relay Agent function
      [RFC6221].

   *  Relay Agent Information Option (RAIO)

      This is a DHCP option defined in [RFC3046].  Also commonly
      referred to as "Option 82".  RAIO options were later extended to
      be able to carry suboptions [RFC6925].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Example Use Case: Switched Fronthaul

   In Radio Access Networks (RANs) the Fronthaul is the network segment
   that connects Radio Units, the distributed radio elements in a mobile
   network, to other network elements.  The aggregation of Radio Unit
   devices (also known as Switched Fronthaul) hides the relationship
   between the Radio Units themselves and the physical ports where they
   are connected.  The Radio Units are the client hosts in the switched
   Fronthaul network and need to be configured based on their Topology.

             Figure 1: Layer 2 Switched Fronthaul Example

   Figure 1 shows multiple Radio Units that are connected to one
   Baseband Unit by means of a Layer 2 switched network.  The Baseband
   Unit is the central processing unit that handles baseband
   information.  A Baseband Unit is often placed rather centrally, while
   the Radio Units need to be distributed to be co-located with or near
   the antennas.  Traffic between Radio Units and Bandband Units is both
   IP-based and Layer-2-based and may pass a hierarchy of L2 switches.

   In order to properly address the Radio Unit, the Baseband Unit needs
   to associate the Radio Unit's MAC address to the L2 switch and
   respective port where the Radio Unit is connected.  To realize this
   device configuration in the Switched Fronthaul network, DHCP can be
   used to discover the network Topology.

4.  Existing DHCP-based Solutions for Topology Discovery

4.1.  IPv6 Clients using DHCPv6

   If the network is fully IPv6 enabled, DHCPv6 [RFC8415] can be used
   for Topology Discovery.  This solution exploits DHCPv6 Relay Agent
   support in the server, whilst Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agents (LDRA)
   [RFC6221] are implemented in the L2 switches to inform DHCPv6 server
   about the L2 Topology.

4.2.  Clients with Dual Connectivity and 4o6 DHCP support

   When the client needs an IPv4 address but is dual connected and can
   support DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 [RFC7341], DHCPv6 [RFC8415] with a DHCPv4-
   over-DHCPv6 compliant DHCP server can be used for Topology Discovery
   whereas DHCP is used still for IP address assignment.

   An example network with 4o6 compliant clients can be sketched as
   follows:

     +---------+
     |   4o6   |    P1 +-+------+     |                   |  +---------+
     | Client  +-------| | LDRA |     |  +----+------+    |  |  4o6    |
     +---------+       | +------+     |  |    | L3RA |    +--|  DHCP   |
                       |  L2    |     +--|    +------+    |  | Server  |
     +---------+    P2 | switch |     |  |           |    |  |         |
     |   4o6   +-------|        +-----|  |   Router  +----|  +---------+
     | Client  |       +--------+     |  +-----------+    |
     +---------+                      |                   |

             Figure 2: Layer 2 Topology discover with 4o6

   In Figure 2 the client supports [RFC7341] by implementing the 4o6
   encapsulation whereas the intermediate nodes implement LDRA [RFC6221]
   or L3RA [RFC8415] and finally the DHCP server is 4o6 DHCP capable
   [RFC7341].

   Still, [RFC7341] does not provide a solution for legacy IPv4 clients
   that respectively do not support 4o6 encapsulation.

5.  Layer 2 Topogoy Discovery using 4o6 DHCP with legacy IPv4 clients

   This document extends [RFC7341] to enable a deployment scenario where
   the 4o6 encapsulation is implemented at the Relay Agent instead of
   the DHCP client.  This makes it possible to enable Topology Discovery
   for legacy IPv4 DHCP clients through a 4o6-DHCP-enabled network.

     +---------+
     |   4o6   |    P1 +-+------+     |                   |  +---------+
     | Client  +-------| | LDRA |     |  +----+------+    |  |  4o6    |
     +---------+       | +------+     |  |    | L3RA |    +--|  DHCP   |
                       |  L2    |     +--|    +------+    |  | Server  |
     +---------+       | switch |     |  |           |    |  +---------+
     | Legacy  |    P2 +------+ +-----|  |   Router  +----|
     | Client  +-------+ 4o6  | |     |  +-----------+    |  +---------+
     +---------+       +------+-+     |                   |  | Legacy  |
                                                          +--|  DHCP   |
                                                          |  | Server  |
                                                          |  +---------+

      Figure 3: Layer 2 architecture with 4o6 and legacy client

   The new scenario, not described in [RFC7341], is shown in Figure 3.
   In such a scenario, the 4o6 encapsulation is implemented in the Relay
   Agent deployed in the edge L2 switch, or in general in the edge
   device providing connectivity to the legacy client.  In this case it
   is up to the Relay Agent to provide the full 4o6 DHCP set of
   functionality whereas the legacy client is not aware of being served
   via a 4o6 DHCP service.

   This new 4o6 Relay Agent (4o6RA), as specified in this document,
   exchanges DHCP messages between clients and servers using the message
   formats established in [RFC8415].  To maintain interoperability with
   existing DHCP relays and servers, the message format is unchanged
   from [RFC8415].  The 4o6RA implements the same message types as a
   normal DHCPv6 Relay Agent Section 6 of [RFC7341].  They are: - Relay-
   Forward Messages - Relay-Reply Messages

   In this specification, the 4o6RA creates the DHCPV4-QUERY Message and
   encapsulates the DHCP request message received from the legacy DHCPv4
   client.

   When DHCPV4-RESPONSE Message is received by the 4o6 Relay Agent, it
   looks for the DHCPv4 Message option within this message.  If this
   option is not found, the DHCPv4-response message MUST be discarded.
   If the DHCPv4 Message option is present, the 4o6RA MUST extract the
   DHCPv4 message and forward the encapsulated DHCPv4-response to the
   legacy DHCPv4 client.

   An Layer 2 Relay Agent receiving DHCPV4-QUERY or DHCPV4-RESPONSE
   messages will handle them as specified in Section 6 of [RFC6221].

6.  Security Considerations

   This documents applies 4o6 DHCP in a scenario where legacy IPv4
   clients are connected to 4o6 DHCP Relay Agent that performs the en-
   and decapsulation.  This document does not change anything else in
   the 4o6 DHCP speacification and therefore the security consideration
   of [RFC7341] still apply.

   The legacy IPv4 client is not aware of this mechanism, however, even
   when 4o6 DHCP is used, the client does not have any control about the
   information provided by the Relay agent.  As such this change does
   not provide any additional secruity concerns.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
