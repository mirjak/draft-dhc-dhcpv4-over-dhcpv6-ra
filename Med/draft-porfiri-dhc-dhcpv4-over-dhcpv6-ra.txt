         DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) with Relay Agent Support
             draft-porfiri-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6-ra-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for networks with legacy
   IPv4-only clients to use services provided by DHCPv6 using DHCPv4-
   over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) in a Relay Agent.  RFC7341 specifies use of
   DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 in the client only.  This document specifies a
   RFC7341-based approach that allows DHCP 4o6 to be deployed as a Relay
   Agent (4o6RA) that implements the 4o6 DHCP encapsulation and
   decapsulation in contexts where it is not possible at the client.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7341] describes a transport mechanism for carrying DHCPv4
   [RFC2131] messages using DHCPv6 [RFC8415] for the dynamic
   provisioning of IPv4 addresses and other DHCPv4 specific
   configuration parameters across IPv6-only networks.  The deployment
   of [RFC7341] requires support in DHCP clients and at the DHCPv6
   server.

   However, if a client is embedded in a host that only supports IPv4
   and cannot easily be replaced or updated due to a number of technical
   or business reasons, this approach does not work.

   Similarly, the specifications for DHCPv6 Relay Agents such as LDRA
   [RFC6221] or L3RA [RFC8415] do not foresee the possibility to handle
   legacy DHCPv4, other than implementing DHCP 4o6 in the client.

   This document specifies an [RFC7341]-based solution that can be
   implemented in intermediate nodes such as switches or routers,
   without putting any requirements on clients.  No new protocols or
   extensions are needed, instead this document specifies an amendment
   to [RFC7341] that allows a Relay Agent to perform the DHCP 4o6
   encapsulation and decapsultion instead of the client.

1.1.  Applicability Scope

   The mechanisms described in this document apply to the configuration
   phase of the host, specifically when a DHCP server for IPv4 [RFC2131]
   is not reacheable directly from the host, the host needs to receive
   an IPv4 address and there's a DHCPv6 server than can provide IPv4
   addresses by means of the mechanisms described in [RFC7341] and the
   host doesn't implement a DHCP client conform to [RFC7341] itself.

3.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Relay Agent (4o6RA)

   This document assumes a network, where IPv4-only hosts are connected
   to a network that supports IPv6 and limited IPv4 services.

   To address such a network setup, this document extends DHCPv6 Relay
   Agents with DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6, as shown in Figure 1.

           Figure 1: Architecture Example with Legacy DHCP Client

   This document specifies the encapsulation and decapsulation described
   in [RFC7341] to be performed in the Relay Agent whereas the DHCPv4
   client does not require any change.  In this case it is up to the
   Relay Agent to provide the full DHCP 4o6 support whereas a legacy
   client is not aware of being served via a DHCP 4o6 service.  All
   prerequisites and configuration that apply to the DHCP client in
   Section 5 of [RFC7341] shall be applied to 4o6RA instead.

   [RFC7341] specifies that before applying for an IPv4 address via a
   DHCPv4-query message, the client must identify a suitable network
   interface for the address.  In the case described in this document
   where the client functionality described in [RFC7341] is replaced by
   4o6RA, it's 4o6RA that shall also identify a suitable interface, that
   can be a network interface or another Relay Agent.

   To maintain interoperability with existing DHCPv6 relays and servers,
   the message format is unchanged from [RFC8415].  The 4o6RA implements
   the same message types as a normal DHCPv6 Relay Agent Section 6 of
   [RFC7341].

   In this specification, the 4o6RA creates the DHCPV4-QUERY Message and
   encapsulates the DHCP request message received from the legacy DHCPv4
   client.

   When DHCPV4-RESPONSE Message is received by the 4o6 Relay Agent, it
   looks for the DHCPv4 Message option within this message.  If this
   option is not found, the DHCPv4-response message MUST be discarded.
   If the DHCPv4 Message option is present, the 4o6RA MUST extract the
   DHCPv4 message and forward the encapsulated DHCPv4-response to the
   requesting DHCPv4 client.

   Layer 2 Relay Agents receiving DHCPV4-QUERY or DHCPV4-RESPONSE
   messages are expected to handle them as specified in Section 6 of
   [RFC6221].

   DHCPv6 servers must be compliant with 4o6 according to [RFC7341].  No
   additional requirements on DHCPv6 servers are set by this
   specification.

3.1.  Intermediate relays

   Intermediate relays shall behave according to section 10 of
   [RFC7341].

3.2.  4o6RA and Topology Discovery

   In some networks the configuration of a host may depend on the
   topology.  However, when the new host attaches to a network, it may
   be unaware of the topology and respectively how it has to be
   configured.

   DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] specifications describe how
   addresses can be allocated to clients based on network topology
   information provided by a DHCP relay, typically.

   Address/prefix allocation decisions are integral to the allocation of
   addresses and prefixes in DHCP.  The argument is described in details
   in [RFC7969], here we want to guarantee that 4o6RA does not break any
   legacy capability when related to the use of topology.

   The topology discovery as described in [RFC7969] differs between IPv4
   and IPv6 as in IPv4 it's only the first Relay Agent that can set the
   giaddr field (section 3.1 of [RFC7969]) thus in a generic network
   involving more than one Relay Agent only part of the topology is
   transported via DHCPv4.

   When in IPv6 context and using DHCPv6, all Relay Agents can fill
   link-address and Interface-ID options, that allows transporting to
   the DHCPv6 server the information about the complete path between the
   DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server.  When in a L2 network, Lightway
   DHCPv6 Relay Agents [RFC6221] can be used.  Then, topology
   information for the given IP address can be obtained from the DHCPv6
   server and used, for configuration or other purposes.

   The adoption of [RFC7341] at the client permits to use the DHCPv6
   mechanisms for topology discovery even in case of DHCPv4, because of
   the DHCPv6 encapsulation and because the DHCPv6 Relay Agent knows the
   interface where the encapsulated DHCP request is received.

   Moving 4o6 in the intermediate node rather than at the client breaks
   the topology propagation as 4o6RA-only does not provide any interface
   information in the encapsulated message.

                       Figure 2: Topology broken path

   As shown in Figure 2, the introduction of 4o6 at the edge of the IPv6
   network hides the L2 network from the DHCPv6 RA.

   In order to preserve the topology information, it is recommended that
   the implementation of 4o6RA is combined with the implementation of
   LDRA [RFC6221] and that the implementation has a mechanism for LDRA
   to get interface information that can be used for the Interface-ID
   option, as specified in Section 5.3.2 of [RFC6221].  The internal
   mechanisms to exchange interface information, their format and
   whether the interface information contains an indication that a 4o6RA
   is involved are out of the scope for this document.

                 | L2 Network  |   |          IPv6 Network       |

        |          |         |  Agent |         |      |          |

                  '-----------'     '---------------------------'

                Figure 3: Topology path preserved with LDRA

   The assumed architecture is shown in Figure 3 where the whole Relay
   Agent is built up with cooperating 4o6RA and LDRA, and an internal
   interface to propagate topology information from 4o6RA to LDRA.

   In a simple case, where the same node hosts the 4o6RA and the DHCP4o6
   server, it might be enough to only use 4o6RA, as shown in Figure 4.

4.  Deployment Considerations

   As clients are not aware of the presence of 4o6RA, the network
   deployment needs to ensure that all DHCPv4 broadcast and unicast
   messages from clients are steered to a 4o6RA.  This can, e.g., be
   achieved by placing the 4o6RA in a central position that can observe
   all traffic from the clients or use of address translation with the
   4o6RA address for unicast messages.

5.  Security Considerations

   This documents specifies the applicability of 4o6 DHCP in a scenario
   where legacy IPv4 clients are connected to 4o6 DHCP Relay Agent that
   performs the en- and decapsulation.  This document does not change
   anything else in the 4o6 DHCP specification and therefore the
   security consideration of [RFC7341] still apply.

   This mechanism differs from [RFC7341] as the DHCP client sends and
   receives DHCPv4 messages, whereas in [RFC7341] it only sends DHCPv6
   messages.  This makes it possible that DHCPv4 messages could reach a
   DHCPv4 server without using the 4o6RA.  While this can cause
   erroneous state in both clients and servers and potentially even lead
   to misconfigurations that impact reachability, this is not seen as a
   security concern rather than a deployment error and even though it
   may be used for attacks from within the network, it's not new and
   it's not being introduced because of this specification.

   More generally, legacy IPv4 clients are not aware of this mechanism,
   however, even when DHCP 4o6 is used, the client does not have any
   control about the information provided by the Relay agent.  As such
   this change does not raise any additional security concerns.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Example Use Case: Topology Discovery for IPv4-only Radio
             Unit in the RAN Switched Fronthaul

   In Radio Access Networks (RANs) the Fronthaul is the network segment
   that connects Radio Units, the distributed radio elements in a mobile
   network, to other network elements.  The aggregation of Radio Unit
   devices (also known as Switched Fronthaul) hides the relationship
   between the Radio Units themselves and the physical ports where they
   are connected.  The Radio Units are the client hosts in the switched
   Fronthaul network and need to be configured based on their Topology.

             Figure 5: Layer 2 Switched Fronthaul Example

   Figure 5 shows multiple Radio Units that are connected to one
   Baseband Unit by means of a Layer 2 switched network.  The Baseband
   Unit is the central processing unit that handles baseband
   information.  A Baseband Unit is often placed rather centrally, while
   the Radio Units need to be distributed to be co-located with or near
   the antennas.  Traffic between Radio Units and Baseband Units is both
   IP-based and Layer-2-based and may pass a hierarchy of L2 switches.

   In order to properly address the Radio Unit, the Baseband Unit needs
   to associate the Radio Unit's MAC address to the L2 switch and
   respective port where the Radio Unit is connected.  To realize this
   device configuration in the Switched Fronthaul network, DHCPv6 can be
   used to discover the network Topology.

   With the L2 switched network between the clients and the server, one
   of the clients is responsible for the configuration of the other
   clients based on their topology.  Updating of the software on the
   clients is not possible often not possible and clients may be
   IPv4-only.
