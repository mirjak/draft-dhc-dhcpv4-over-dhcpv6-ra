              DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 with Relay Agent Support
              draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6-ra-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for networks with legacy
   IPv4-only clients to use services provided by DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 in a
   Relay Agent.  RFC7341 specifies use of DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 in the
   client only.  This document specifies a RFC7341-based approach that
   allows a Relay Agent to implement the DHCP 4o6 encapsulation and
   decapsulation of DHCPv4 messages in DHCPv6 messages on behalf of a
   DHCPv4 client.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7341] describes a transport mechanism for carrying DHCPv4
   [RFC2131] messages using DHCPv6 [draft-ietf-dhc-rfc8415bis] for
   dynamic provisioning of IPv4 addresses and other DHCPv4 specific
   configuration parameters across IPv6-only networks.  The deployment
   of [RFC7341] requires support in DHCP clients and at the DHCPv6
   server.  However, if a client is embedded in a host that only
   supports IPv4 and cannot easily be replaced or updated (which could
   be due to any number of technical or business reasons), this approach
   does not work.

   Similarly, the specifications for DHCPv6 Relay Agents such as
   Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (LDRA) [RFC6221] or DHCPv6 Relay Agent
   (L3RA) [draft-ietf-dhc-rfc8415bis] do not foresee the possibility to
   handle legacy DHCPv4, other than implementing DHCP 4o6 in the client.

   This document specifies an [RFC7341] based solution that can be
   implemented in intermediate nodes such as switches or routers,
   without putting any requirements on clients.  No new protocols or
   extensions are needed; instead, this document specifies a new use
   case for [RFC7341] that allows a Relay Agent to perform the DHCP 4o6
   encapsulation and decapsulation instead of the client.

1.1.  Applicability Scope

   The mechanisms described in this document apply to the configuration
   phase of hosts that need to receive an IPv4 address when a DHCP
   server for IPv4 [RFC2131] is not reachable directly from the host.
   Furthermore, the host is unable to implement a DHCP client conformant
   to [RFC7341] as it is connected to an IPv4-only network.  But there
   is a DHCPv6 server that can provide IPv4 addresses by means of the
   mechanisms specified in [RFC7341].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The following terms and acronyms are used in this document:

   *  DHCP: If not otherwise specified, DHCP refers to DHCPv4 and/or
      DHCPv6.

   *  DHCPv4: DHCP as defined in [RFC2131].

   *  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 (or 4o6): The architecture, the procedures, and
      the protocols specified in the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 document
      [RFC7341].

   *  DHCP Relay Agent: This is a concept in all of the following
      protocols, although the details differ between them: BOOTP
      [RFC951] [RFC1542], DHCPv4 [RFC2131] [RFC2132], and DHCPv6
      [draft-ietf-dhc-rfc8415bis].

   *  Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (or LDRA): This is an extension of
      the original DHCPv6 Relay Agent specification, to allow layer-
      2-only devices to perform a Relay Agent function [RFC6221].

   *  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Relay Agent (or 4o6RA): Refers to a Relay Agent
      that implements the 4o6 transport as specified in this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Relay Agent (4o6RA)

   This document assumes a network, where IPv4-only hosts are connected
   to a network that supports IPv6 and limited IPv4 services.

   To address such a network setup, this document extends DHCPv6 Relay
   Agents with DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6, as shown in Figure 1.

           Figure 1: Architecture Example with Legacy DHCP Client

   This document specifies the encapsulation and decapsulation specified
   in [RFC7341] to be performed in the Relay Agent without requiring any
   changes on the DHCPv4 client.  In this case it is up to the Relay
   Agent to provide the full DHCP 4o6 support and the legacy DHCPv4
   client is not aware that it is being served via a DHCP 4o6 service.
   As the 4o6RA acts as a DHCP 4o6 client, all prerequisites and
   configuration that apply to the DHCP client in Section 5 of [RFC7341]
   are also applied to the 4o6RA.

   As the 4o6RA takes the role of the client in respect to [RFC7341], it
   is responsible for determining a suitable interface where it acts as
   a DHCPv6 client, and it is responsible for locating a suitable DHCPv6
   server or relay agent and obtain the necessary IPv6 configuration..
   As specified in [RFC7341], the 4o6RA, acting as 4o6 client, therefore
   has to request the DHCP 4o6 Server Address option from the server by
   sending the Option Request option as described in
   [draft-ietf-dhc-rfc8415bis] before it can use the 4o6 transport.

   To maintain interoperability with existing DHCPv6 relays and servers,
   the message format is unchanged from [draft-ietf-dhc-rfc8415bis].
   The 4o6RA implements the same message types as a DHCPv6 Relay Agent
   Section 6 of [RFC7341].

   However, in this specification, the 4o6RA, instead of the client,
   creates the DHCPV4-QUERY Message and encapsulates the DHCP request
   message received from the legacy DHCPv4 client.

   When DHCPV4-RESPONSE Message is received by the 4o6 Relay Agent, it
   looks for the DHCPv4 Message option within this message.  If this
   option is not found or the DHCPv4-RESPONSE message is not well-
   formed, it MUST be discarded.  If the DHCPv4 Message option is
   present, and correct, the 4o6RA MUST extract the DHCPv4 message and
   forward the encapsulated DHCPv4-response to the requesting DHCPv4
   client, given that the encapsulated DHCPv4-response is correct and
   can be actually forwarded.

   Layer-2 Relay Agents receiving DHCPV4-QUERY or DHCPV4-RESPONSE
   messages MUST handle them as specified in Section 6 of [RFC6221].

   In any given environment, DHCPv6 servers to which DHCPV4-QUERY
   requests are routed are expected to be compliant with 4o6 according
   to [RFC7341].  No additional requirements on DHCPv6 servers are set
   by this specification.

3.1.  Intermediate relays

   Intermediate relays shall behave according to section 10 of
   [RFC7341].

3.2.  4o6RA and Topology Discovery

   In some networks, the configuration of a host may depend on the
   topology.  However, when a new host attaches to a network, it may be
   unaware of the topology and, consequently, how it must be
   configured..

   DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [draft-ietf-dhc-rfc8415bis]
   specifications describe how addresses can be allocated to clients
   based on network topology information provided by a DHCP relay,
   typically.

   Address/prefix allocation decisions are integral to the allocation of
   addresses and prefixes in DHCP, as described in detail in [RFC7969].
   This specification aims to guarantee that the 4o6RA does not break
   any legacy capability when used for topology discovery.

   Topology discovery as described in [RFC7969] differs between IPv4 and
   IPv6:

   *  IPv4: when using DHCP on IPv4 only the first Relay Agent SHOULD
      set the giaddr field (section 3.1 of [RFC7969]).  Thus, in a
      network that has more than one Relay Agent only part of the
      topology is transported via DHCPv4.

   *  IPv6: when using DHCPv6, all Relay Agents SHOULD send link-address
      and Interface-ID options, that provide information about the
      complete path between the DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server to
      the DHCPv6 server.

   In Layer-2 networks, Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agents [RFC6221] can be
   used.

   When provided, the topology information is available at the DHCPv6
   server in the form of a sequence of the link-address field and
   Interface-ID option.

   Then, topology information for the given IP address can be obtained
   from the DHCPv6 server and used for configuration or other purposes.

   [RFC7341] enables the client to use DHCPv6 for topology discovery
   even within a DHCPv4 context, as the DHCPv6 Relay Agent knows the
   interface where the encapsulated DHCP request is received.  As shown
   in Figure 2, however, the introduction of 4o6 at the edge of the IPv6
   network hides the Layer-2 network from the DHCPv6 RA.  As such,
   moving 4o6 to a intermediate node rather than performing it at the
   client breaks the topology propagation, as 4o6RA-only solution does
   not provide any interface information in the encapsulated message.

                Figure 2: Broken topology information

   In order to provide full topology information, it is RECOMMENDED that
   any implementation of 4o6RA be combined with an LDRA implementation
   [RFC6221] in a back-to-back structure, and that the LDRA
   implementation includes a mechanism to obtain interface information
   that can be used to provide the Interface-ID option to outgoing
   DHCPV4-QUERY messages, as specified in Section 5.3.2 of [RFC6221].

   The internal mechanisms to exchange interface information, their
   format and whether the interface information contains an indication
   that a 4o6RA is involved are out of the scope for this document.

   The resulting architecture is shown in Figure 3 where the Relay Agent
   is implementing 4o6RA and LDRA, and has an internal interface to
   propagate topology information from 4o6RA to LDRA.

             Figure 3: Topology information preserved with LDRA

   In a simple case, where the same node hosts the 4o6RA and the DHCP4o6
   server, it might be enough to only use 4o6RA, as shown in Figure 4.

4.  Deployment Considerations

   As clients are unaware of the presence of 4o6RA, the network
   deployment MUST ensure that all DHCPv4 broadcast and unicast messages
   to and from clients are steered via a 4o6RA.  This can be achieved by
   placing the 4o6RA in a central position that can intercept all
   traffic from the clients, or by using Network Address Translation
   (NAT) with the 4o6RA address for unicast messages.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies the applicability of 4o6 DHCP in a scenario
   where legacy IPv4 clients are connected to 4o6 DHCP Relay Agents that
   perform the encapsulation and decapsulation.  This document does not
   change anything else in the 4o6 DHCP specification and therefore the
   security considerations of [RFC7341] still apply.  Since the legacy
   IPv4 client is not aware of an additional mechanism, the 4o6RA has to
   provide the protections that [RFC7341]'s security considerations
   discusses.

   The mechanisms defined here differ from [RFC7341] as they allow the
   DHCP client to send and receive DHCPv4 messages, whereas in [RFC7341]
   the client only sends DHCPv6 messages.  This makes it possible that
   in improperly configured networks where the client is located on the
   same Layer-2 scope of a DHCPv4 server, DHCPv4 messages could reach a
   DHCPv4 server without using the 4o6RA.  While this can cause
   erroneous state in both clients and servers and potentially even lead
   to misconfigurations that impact reachability, this is seen as a
   deployment error rather than a security concern.  Further, even
   though this mechanism may be used for attacks from within the
   network, this is not a new concern introduced by this specification.

   More generally, legacy IPv4 clients are not aware of this mechanism,
   however, even when DHCP 4o6 is used, the client does not have any
   control about the information provided by the Relay agent.  As such
   this change does not raise any additional security concerns.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Example Use Case: Topology Discovery for IPv4-only Radio
             Unit in 3GPP RAN with Switched Fronthaul

   In 3GPP mobile network architecture, the User Equipments (UE) are
   connected via Radio Access Network (RAN).  RAN is built up with
   Baseband Units (BB) and Radio Units (RU).  Radio Fronthaul Network
   (FH) connects RU and BB, each of RU and BB is an IP host, they may
   support IPv4 only, IPv6 only or both depending on the vendor and the
   model.  Each RU is unique as it is tied to a set of antennas, and
   each antenna is serving a specific Cell and Sector.  Each RU is
   configured by the BB depending on the Cell and Sectors it serves.
   However, that dependency is only specified by the cabling between RU
   and antennas.  BB can be cabled to RU directly or via a Layer-2
   switched network.

           Figure 5: 3GPP RAN where RU are cabled directly to BB

   In Figure 5 BB is directly cabled to a set of RUs, the BB can
   recognize the relationship between RUs and Cell/Sectors based on the
   cabling between the RUs and antennas.

   When BBs and RUs are connected via a Layer-2 switched network, the
   added level of complexity requires the BBs to have a deeper knowledge
   of the topology in order to properly configure the RUs, involving
   knowledge of all the cabling in the switched network.

   Examples for switched networks are shown in section 3 of [RFC7969]
   and demonstrate the different levels of complexity.  An example of a
   FH is depicted in Figure 6.

      Figure 6: 3GPP RAN with Layer-2 Switched Fronthaul Example

   If IPv6 is used and all RU are capable of DHCPv6 in Figure 6, DHCP
   topology knowledge can be used for solving the RU configuration
   problem.  Such solution would use the topology discovery mechanisms
   described in section 3.2 of [RFC7969].

   If RU are capable of IPv4 only but implement a 4o6 client according
   to [RFC7341], the same topology discovery mechanisms are applicable.

   If RU are capable of IPV4 only and cannot implement a 4o6 client
   according to [RFC7341], the topology discovery mechanisms described
   in section 3.2 of [RFC7969] can be used by introducing 4o6RA in the
   switches as decribed in this document.
