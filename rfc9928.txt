              DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 with Relay Agent Support

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for networks with legacy
   IPv4-only clients to use services provided by DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 in a
   Relay Agent.  RFC 7341 specifies the use of DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 in the
   client only.  This document specifies an approach based on RFC 7341
   that allows a Relay Agent to implement the DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
   encapsulation and decapsulation of DHCPv4 messages in DHCPv6 messages
   on behalf of a DHCPv4 client.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7341] describes a transport mechanism for carrying DHCPv4
   [RFC2131] messages using DHCPv6 [RFC9915] for dynamic provisioning of
   IPv4 addresses and other DHCPv4-specific configuration parameters
   across IPv6-only networks.  The deployment of [RFC7341] requires
   support in DHCP clients and at the DHCPv6 server.  However, if a
   client is embedded in a host that only supports IPv4 and cannot
   easily be replaced or updated (which could be due to any number of
   technical or business reasons), this approach does not work.

   Similarly, the DHCPv6 Relay Agent specification defined in [RFC9915],
   which also refers to [RFC6221] for the Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent
   (LDRA) behavior, does not provide any mechanism to handle legacy
   DHCPv4, except by requiring the client to implement DHCP 4o6

   This document specifies a solution based on [RFC7341] that can be
   implemented in intermediate nodes such as switches or routers,
   without putting any requirements on clients.  No new protocols or
   extensions are needed; instead, this document specifies a new use
   case for [RFC7341] that allows a Relay Agent to perform the DHCPv4
   over DHCPv6 encapsulation and decapsulation instead of the client.

1.1.  Applicability Scope

   The mechanisms described in this document apply to the configuration
   phase of hosts that need to receive an IPv4 address when a DHCP
   server for IPv4 [RFC2131] is not reachable directly from the host.
   Furthermore, the host is unable to implement a DHCP client conformant
   to [RFC7341], as it is connected to an IPv4-only network.  However,
   there is a DHCPv6 server that can provide IPv4 addresses by means of
   the mechanisms specified in [RFC7341].

3.  DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 Relay Agent (4o6RA)

   This document assumes a network where IPv4-only hosts are connected

   To address such a network setup, this document extends DHCPv6 Relay
   Agents with DHCPv4 over DHCPv6, as shown in Figure 1.

           Figure 1: Architecture Example with Legacy DHCP Client

   This document specifies the encapsulation and decapsulation specified
   in [RFC7341] to be performed in the Relay Agent without requiring any
   changes on the DHCPv4 client.  In this case, it is up to the Relay
   Agent to provide the full DHCP 4o6 support, and the legacy DHCPv4
   client is not aware that it is being served via a DHCP 4o6 service.
   As the 4o6RA acts as a DHCP 4o6 client, all prerequisites and
   configurations that apply to the DHCP client in Section 5 of
   [RFC7341] are also applied to the 4o6RA.

   As the 4o6RA takes the role of the client in respect to [RFC7341], it
   is responsible for determining a suitable interface where it acts as
   a DHCPv6 client, and it is responsible for locating a suitable DHCPv6
   server or Relay Agent and obtaining the necessary IPv6 configuration.
   As specified in [RFC7341], the 4o6RA, acting as DHCP 4o6 client,
   therefore has to request the DHCP 4o6 Server Address option from the
   server by sending the Option Request option as described in [RFC9915]
   before it can use the DHCP 4o6 transport.

   To maintain interoperability with existing DHCPv6 relays and servers,
   the message format is unchanged from [RFC9915].  The 4o6RA implements
   the same message types as a DHCPv6 Relay Agent (see Section 6 of
   [RFC7341]).

   However, in this specification, the 4o6RA, instead of the client,
   creates the DHCPV4-QUERY message and encapsulates the DHCP request
   message received from the legacy DHCPv4 client.

   When the DHCPV4-RESPONSE message is received by the DHCP 4o6 Relay
   Agent, it looks for the DHCPv4 message option within this message.
   If this option is not found or the DHCPv4-RESPONSE message is not
   well-formed, it MUST be discarded.  If the DHCPv4 message option is
   present and correct, the 4o6RA MUST extract the DHCPv4 message and
   forward the encapsulated DHCPv4-RESPONSE to the requesting DHCPv4
   client, given that the encapsulated DHCPv4-RESPONSE is correct and
   can be actually forwarded.

   Layer 2 (L2) Relay Agents receiving DHCPV4-QUERY or DHCPV4-RESPONSE
   messages MUST handle them as specified in Section 6 of [RFC6221].

   In any given environment, DHCPv6 servers to which DHCPV4-QUERY
   requests are routed are expected to be compliant with DHCP 4o6
   according to [RFC7341].  No additional requirements on DHCPv6 servers
   are set by this specification.

3.1.  Intermediate Relays

   Intermediate relays shall behave according to Section 10 of
   [RFC7341].

3.2.  4o6RA and Topology Discovery

   In some networks, the configuration of a host may depend on the
   topology.  However, when a new host attaches to a network, it may be
   unaware of the topology and, consequently, how it has to be
   configured.

   DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC9915] specifications describe how
   addresses can typically be allocated to clients based on network
   topology information provided by a DHCP relay.

   Address/prefix allocation decisions are integral to the allocation of
   addresses and prefixes in DHCP, as described in detail in [RFC7969].
   This specification aims to guarantee that the 4o6RA does not break
   any legacy capability when used for topology discovery.

   Topology discovery as described in [RFC7969] differs between IPv4 and
   IPv6 as follows:

   *  IPv4: When using DHCP on IPv4, only the first Relay Agent SHOULD
      set the giaddr field (Section 3.1 of [RFC7969]).  Thus, in a
      network that has more than one Relay Agent, only part of the
      topology is transported via DHCPv4.

   *  IPv6: When using DHCPv6, all Relay Agents SHOULD send link-address
      and Interface-ID options that provide information about the
      complete path between the DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server to
      the DHCPv6 server.

   In Layer 2 networks, Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agents (LDRAs)
   [RFC6221] can be used.

   When provided, the topology information is available at the DHCPv6
   server in the form of a sequence of the link-address field and
   Interface-ID option.

   Then, topology information for the given IP address can be obtained
   from the DHCPv6 server and used for configuration or other purposes.

   [RFC7341] enables the client to use DHCPv6 for topology discovery
   even within a DHCPv4 context, as the DHCPv6 Relay Agent knows the
   interface where the encapsulated DHCP request is received.  However,
   as shown in Figure 2, the introduction of DHCP 4o6 at the edge of the
   IPv6 network hides the Layer 2 network from the DHCPv6 RA.  As such,
   moving DHCP 4o6 to an intermediate node rather than performing it at
   the client breaks the topology propagation, as 4o6RA-only solutions
   do not provide any interface information in the encapsulated message.

                Figure 2: Broken Topology Information

   In order to provide full topology information, it is RECOMMENDED that
   any implementation of 4o6RA be combined with an LDRA implementation
   [RFC6221] in a back-to-back structure and that the LDRA
   implementation includes a mechanism to obtain interface information
   that can be used to provide the Interface-ID option to outgoing
   DHCPV4-QUERY messages, as specified in Section 5.3.2 of [RFC6221].

   The internal mechanisms to exchange interface information, their
   format, and whether the interface information contains an indication
   that a 4o6RA is involved, are out of the scope for this document.

   The resulting architecture is shown in Figure 3 where the Relay Agent
   is implementing 4o6RA and LDRA and has an internal interface to
   propagate topology information from 4o6RA to LDRA.

             Figure 3: Topology Information Preserved with LDRA

   In a simple case, where the same node hosts the 4o6RA and the DHCP
   4o6 server, it might be enough to only use 4o6RA, as shown in
   Figure 4, where CPE stands for "Customer Premises Equipment".

4.  Deployment Considerations

   As clients are unaware of the presence of 4o6RA, the network
   deployment needs to ensure that all DHCPv4 broadcast and unicast
   messages to and from clients are steered via a 4o6RA.  This can be
   achieved by placing the 4o6RA in a central position that can
   intercept all traffic from the clients or by using Network Address
   Translation (NAT) with the 4o6RA address for unicast messages.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies the applicability of DHCP 4o6 in a scenario
   where legacy IPv4 clients are connected to DHCP 4o6 Relay Agents that
   perform the encapsulation and decapsulation.  This document does not
   change anything else in the DHCP 4o6 specification [RFC7341];
   therefore, the security considerations of that document still apply.
   Specifically, since the legacy IPv4 client is not aware of the
   encapsulation and decapsulation, 4o6RA has to provide the protections
   that are specified in the security considerations in Section 12 of
   [RFC7341].

   The mechanisms defined here differ from [RFC7341] as they allow the
   DHCP client to send and receive DHCPv4 messages, whereas in
   [RFC7341], the client only sends DHCPv6 messages.  This makes it
   possible that in improperly configured networks where the client is
   located on the same Layer 2 scope of a DHCPv4 server, DHCPv4 messages
   could reach a DHCPv4 server without using the 4o6RA.  While this can
   cause erroneous state in both clients and servers and potentially
   even lead to misconfigurations that impact reachability, this is seen
   as a deployment error rather than a security concern.  Further, even
   though this mechanism may be used for attacks from within the
   network, this is not a new concern introduced by this specification.

   More generally, legacy IPv4 clients are not aware of this mechanism;
   however, even when DHCP 4o6 is used, the client does not have any
   control about the information provided by the Relay Agent.  As such,
   this change does not raise any additional security concerns.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Example Use Case: Topology Discovery for IPv4-Only Radio
             Unit in 3GPP RAN with Switched Fronthaul

   In 3GPP mobile network architecture, the User Equipment (UE) is
   connected via a Radio Access Network (RAN).  RAN is built up with
   Baseband Units (BBUs) and Radio Units (RUs).  A radio Fronthaul (FH)
   network connects RUs and BBUs.  Each RU and BBU is an IP host, and
   they may support IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or both, depending on the
   vendor and the model.  Each RU is unique as it is tied to a set of
   antennas, and each antenna is serving a specific Cell and Sector.
   Each RU is configured by the BB depending on the Cell and Sectors it
   serves.  However, that dependency is only specified by the cabling
   between RUs and antennas.  BBs can be cabled to RUs directly or via a
   Layer 2 switched network.

           Figure 5: 3GPP RAN Where RUs Are Cabled Directly to BB

   In Figure 5, the BB is directly cabled to a set of RUs, and the BB
   can recognize the relationship between RUs and Cell/Sectors based on
   the cabling between the RUs and antennas.

   When BBs and RUs are connected via a Layer 2 switched network, the
   added level of complexity requires the BBs to have a deeper knowledge
   of the topology in order to properly configure the RUs, involving
   knowledge of all the cabling in the switched network.

   Examples for switched networks are shown in Section 3 of [RFC7969]
   and demonstrate the different levels of complexity.  An example of a
   FH is depicted in Figure 6.

      Figure 6: 3GPP RAN with Layer 2 Switched Fronthaul Example

   If IPv6 is used and all RUs are capable of DHCPv6 in Figure 6, DHCP
   topology knowledge can be used for solving the RU configuration
   problem.  Such solution would use the topology discovery mechanisms
   described in Section 3.2 of [RFC7969].

   If RUs are capable of IPv4 only but implement a DHCP 4o6 client
   according to [RFC7341], the same topology discovery mechanisms are
   applicable.

   If RUs are capable of IPv4 only and cannot implement a DHCP 4o6
   client according to [RFC7341], the topology discovery mechanisms
   described in Section 3.2 of [RFC7969] can be used by introducing
   4o6RA in the switches as described in this document.
