         DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) with Relay Agent Support
              draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6-ra-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for networks with legacy
   IPv4-only clients to use services provided by DHCPv6 using DHCPv4-
   over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) in a Relay Agent.  RFC7341 specifies use of
   DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 in the client only.  This document specifies a
   RFC7341-based approach that allows DHCP 4o6 to be deployed as a Relay
   Agent (4o6RA) that implements the 4o6 DHCP encapsulation and
   decapsulation in an intermediate node rather than the client.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7341] describes a transport mechanism for carrying DHCPv4
   [RFC2131] messages using DHCPv6 [RFC8415] for dynamic provisioning of
   IPv4 addresses and other DHCPv4 specific configuration parameters
   across IPv6-only networks.  The deployment of [RFC7341] requires
   support in DHCP clients and at the DHCPv6 server.  However, if a
   client is embedded in a host that only supports IPv4 and cannot
   easily be replaced or updated due to a number of technical or
   business reasons, this approach does not work.

   Similarly, the specifications for DHCPv6 Relay Agents such as LDRA
   [RFC6221] or L3RA [RFC8415] do not foresee the possibility to handle
   legacy DHCPv4, other than implementing DHCP 4o6 in the client.

   This document specifies an [RFC7341]-based solution that can be
   implemented in intermediate nodes such as switches or routers,
   without putting any requirements on clients.  No new protocols or
   extensions are needed, instead this document specifies an amendment
   to [RFC7341] that allows a Relay Agent to perform the DHCP 4o6
   encapsulation and decapsultion instead of the client.

1.1.  Applicability Scope

   The mechanisms described in this document apply to the configuration
   phase of hosts that need to receive an IPv4 address but a DHCP server
   for IPv4 [RFC2131] is not reacheable directly from the host.  Further
   the host is not able to implement a DHCP client conform to [RFC7341]
   itself as it is connected to an IPv4-only network.  But there is a
   DHCPv6 server that can provide IPv4 addresses by means of the
   mechanisms described in [RFC7341].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

3.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Relay Agent (4o6RA)

   This document assumes a network, where IPv4-only hosts are connected
   to a network that supports IPv6 and limited IPv4 services.

   To address such a network setup, this document extends DHCPv6 Relay
   Agents with DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6, as shown in Figure 1.

           Figure 1: Architecture Example with Legacy DHCP Client

   This document specifies the encapsulation and decapsulation described
   in [RFC7341] to be performed in the Relay Agent whereas the DHCPv4
   client does not require any change.  In this case it is up to the
   Relay Agent to provide the full DHCP 4o6 support whereas a legacy
   client is not aware of being served via a DHCP 4o6 service.  As the
   4o6RA is acting as a DHCP 4o6 client, all prerequisites and
   configuration that apply to the DHCP client in Section 5 of [RFC7341]
   are also applied to the 4o6RA.

   As the 4o6RA takes the role of the client in respect to [RFC7341], it
   also takes the responsibility for finding a suitable interface; that
   can be a network interface or another Relay Agent.

   To maintain interoperability with existing DHCPv6 relays and servers,
   the message format is unchanged from [RFC8415].  The 4o6RA implements
   the same message types as a DHCPv6 Relay Agent Section 6 of
   [RFC7341].

   However, in this specification, the 4o6RA, instead of the client,
   creates the DHCPV4-QUERY Message and encapsulates the DHCP request
   message received from the legacy DHCPv4 client.

   When DHCPV4-RESPONSE Message is received by the 4o6 Relay Agent, it
   looks for the DHCPv4 Message option within this message.  If this
   option is not found or the DHCPv4-response message is not well-
   formed, it MUST be discarded.  If the DHCPv4 Message option is
   present, the 4o6RA MUST extract the DHCPv4 message and forward the
   encapsulated DHCPv4-response to the requesting DHCPv4 client.

   Layer 2 Relay Agents receiving DHCPV4-QUERY or DHCPV4-RESPONSE
   messages MUST be handled as specified in Section 6 of [RFC6221].

   DHCPv6 servers is expected to be compliant with 4o6 according to
   [RFC7341].  No additional requirements on DHCPv6 servers are set by
   this specification.

3.1.  Intermediate relays

   Intermediate relays shall behave according to section 10 of
   [RFC7341].

3.2.  4o6RA and Topology Discovery

   In some networks the configuration of a host may depend on the
   topology.  However, when the new host attaches to a network, it may
   be unaware of the topology and respectively how it has to be
   configured.

   DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] specifications describe how
   addresses can be allocated to clients based on network topology
   information provided by a DHCP relay, typically.

   Address/prefix allocation decisions are integral to the allocation of
   addresses and prefixes in DHCP, as decsribed in details in [RFC7969].
   In specification aims to guarantee that the 4o6RA does not break any
   legacy capability when used for topology discovery.

   Topology discovery as described in [RFC7969] differs between IPv4 and
   IPv6 as for IPv4 only the first Relay Agent can set the giaddr field
   (section 3.1 of [RFC7969]).  Thus in a network that has more than one
   Relay Agent only part of the topology is transported via DHCPv4.

   When using DHCPv6, all Relay Agents can send link-address and
   Interface-ID options, that provide information about the complete
   path between the DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server to the DHCPv6
   server.

   In L2 networks, Lightway DHCPv6 Relay Agents [RFC6221] can be used.
   Then, topology information for the given IP address can be obtained
   from the DHCPv6 server and used for configuration or other purposes.

   [RFC7341] anables the client to use DHCPv6 for topology discovery
   even within an DHCPv4 context, as the DHCPv6 Relay Agent knows the
   interface where the encapsulated DHCP request is received.  As shown
   in Figure 2, the introduction of 4o6 at the edge of the IPv6 network,
   however, hides the L2 network from the DHCPv6 RA.  As such moving 4o6
   in a intermediate node rather than performaing it at the client,
   breaks the topology propagation as 4o6RA-only does not provide any
   interface information in the encapsulated message.

               .-----------.     .-------------------------.
              | L2 Network  |   |        IPv6 Network       |
     +--------+-+         +-+---+---+    +--------+       +-+--------+
     |  DHCPv4  |         |  4o6    |    | DHCPv6 |       | DHCP 4o6 |
     |  Client  +---------+  Relay  +----+ Relay  +-------+  Server  |
     |          |         |  Agent  |    | Agent  |       |          |
     +--------+-+         +-+---+---+    +--------+       +-+--------+

               '-----------'     '-------------------------'

                       Figure 2: Topology broken path

   In order to preserve the topology information, it is RECOMMENDED that
   the implementation of 4o6RA is combined with the implementation of
   LDRA [RFC6221] and that the implementation has a mechanism for LDRA
   to get interface information that can be used for the Interface-ID
   option, as specified in Section 5.3.2 of [RFC6221].  The internal
   mechanisms to exchange interface information, their format and
   whether the interface information contains an indication that a 4o6RA
   is involved are out of the scope for this document.

   The resulting architecture is shown in Figure 3 where the Relay Agent
   is implementing 4o6RA and LDRA, and has an internal interface to
   propagate topology information from 4o6RA to LDRA.

                  .-----------.     .---------------------------.
                 | L2 Network  |   |          IPv6 Network       |

        |  Client  +---------+  Relay + RFC6221 +------+  Server  |
        |          |         |  Agent |         |      |          |
        +--------+-+         +-+---+--+---------+      +----------+
                 |             |   |                             |
                  '-----------'     '---------------------------'

                Figure 3: Topology path preserved with LDRA

   In a simple case, where the same node hosts the 4o6RA and the DHCP4o6
   server, it might be enough to only use 4o6RA, as shown in Figure 4.

4.  Deployment Considerations

   As clients are not aware of the presence of 4o6RA, the network
   deployment needs to ensure that all DHCPv4 broadcast and unicast
   messages from clients are steered to a 4o6RA.  This can be achieved
   by placing the 4o6RA in a central position that can observe all
   traffic from the clients or use address translation with the 4o6RA
   address for unicast messages.

5.  Security Considerations

   This documents specifies the applicability of 4o6 DHCP in a scenario
   where legacy IPv4 clients are connected to 4o6 DHCP Relay Agents that
   performs the encapsulation and decapsulation.  This document does not
   change anything else in the 4o6 DHCP specification and therefore the
   security consideration of [RFC7341] still apply.

   The mechanisms defined here differ from [RFC7341] as they allow the
   DHCP client to send and receive DHCPv4 messages, whereas in [RFC7341]
   the client only sends DHCPv6 messages.  This makes it possible that
   in not properly configured networks where the client is located on
   the same L2 scope of a DHCPv4 server, DHCPv4 messages could reach a
   DHCPv4 server without using the 4o6RA.  While this can cause
   erroneous state in both clients and servers and potentially even lead
   to misconfigurations that impact reachability, this is not seen as a
   security concern rather than a deployment error.  Further, even
   though it may be used for attacks from within the network, this is
   not new and it is not introduced because of this specification.

   More generally, legacy IPv4 clients are not aware of this mechanism,
   however, even when DHCP 4o6 is used, the client does not have any
   control about the information provided by the Relay agent.  As such
   this change does not raise any additional security concerns.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Example Use Case: Topology Discovery for IPv4-only Radio
             Unit in the RAN Switched Fronthaul

   The Radio Fronthaul Network (FH) is built up with Radio Units (RU)
   and Baseband Units (BB), each being an IP host.  Each RU is unique as
   it is tied to a set of antennas, and each antenna is serving a
   specific Cell and Sector.  Each RU is configured by the BB depending
   on the Cell and Sectors it serves.  However, that dependency is only
   specified by the cabling between RU and antennas.

   If BB is directly cabled to a set of RUs, the BB can recognize the
   relationship between RUs and Cell/Sectors based on the cabling
   between the RUs and antennas.

   The introduction of a switched network between RUs and BBs has added
   a level of complexity that requires the BBs to have a deeper
   knowledge of the topology in order to properly configure the RUs,
   involving knowledge of all the cabling in the switched network.

   Examples for switched networks are show in section 3 of [RFC7969] and
   demonstrate the different levels of complexity.  An example of a FH
   is depicted in Figure 5.

   Among the various alternatives, DHCP topology knowledge can be used
   for solving the RU configuration problem when the FH is IPv6.  Such
   solution would use the topology discovery mechanisms described in
   section 3.2 of [RFC7969].  The same mechanisms applies when RUs are
   connected via IPv4 and implement 4o6 according to [RFC7341].

   In order to extend the solution described above also to the case
   where RUs are using IPv4 but cannot support [RFC7341], the mechanisms
   described in this document can be used by introducing 4o6RA in the
   switches.
