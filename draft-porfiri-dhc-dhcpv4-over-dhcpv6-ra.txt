              DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 with Relay Agent Support
             draft-porfiri-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6-ra-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a general mechanism for networks with legacy
   IPv4-only clients to use all services provided by DHCPv6 DHCPv4-over-
   DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) like for instance discovering information about
   network Topology.  To address this scenario, this document specifies
   an amendment to RFC7341 that allows DHCP 4o6 to be deployed as a
   Relay Agent (4o6RA) where 4o6 DHCP en- and decapsulation will be
   implemented even when this is not possible at the client.

1.  Introduction

   As the migration towards IPv6 continues, IPv6-only networks will
   become more prevalent.  In such networks, IPv4 connectivity will
   continue to be provided as a service over IPv6-only networks.  In
   addition to provisioning IPv4 addresses for clients of this service,
   other IPv4 configuration parameters may also be needed (e.g.,
   addresses of IPv4-only services).

   The transport mechanism for carrying DHCPv4 messages using the DHCPv6
   protocol is described in [RFC7341] for the dynamic provisioning of
   IPv4 addresses and other DHCPv4 specific configuration parameters
   across IPv6-only networks.

   The deployment of [RFC7341] requires implementation in all the legacy
   DHCP clients and at the DHCPv6 server.

   In some cases, updating the clients may be not feasible due to a
   number of technical or business reasons.

   This document describes how the mechanisms needed for deploying a
   [RFC7341] compliant solution can be implemented at the intermediate
   nodes such as L2 switches or routers, without putting any requirement
   on clients.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The following terms and acronyms are used in this document:

   *  CPE: Customer Premises Equipment (also known as Customer Provided
      Equipment), which provides access for devices connected to a Local
      Area Network (LAN), typically at the customer's site/home, to the
      Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) network.

   *  DHCP 4o6 client (or client): A DHCP client supporting both the
      DHCPv6 protocol [RFC3315] as well as the DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
      protocol described in this document.  Such a client is capable of
      requesting IPv6 configuration using DHCPv6 and IPv4 configuration
      using DHCPv4 over DHCPv6.

   *  DHCP 4o6 server (or server): A DHCP server that is capable of
      processing DHCPv4 packets encapsulated in the DHCPv4 Message
      option (defined below).

   *  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 (or 4o6): The architecture, the procedures and
      the protocols described in the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 document
      [RFC7341].

   *  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Relay Agent (or 4o6RA): The 4o6 Relay Agent is
      the part of an LDRA implementing 4o6

   *  DHCP Relay Agent (or RA):

      This is a concept in all of the protocols, BOOTP [RFC0951]
      [RFC1542], DHCPv4 [RFC2131] [RFC2132], and DHCPv6 [RFC8415],
      although the details differ between the protocols.

   *  Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (or LDRA):

      This is an extension of the original DHCPv6 Relay Agent mechanism,
      to support also Layer 2 devices performing a Relay Agent function
      [RFC6221].

   *  LLDP: Link Layer Discovery Protocol

   *  Relay Agent Information Option (or RAIO):

      This is a DHCP option defined in [RFC3046].  Also commonly
      referred to as "Option 82".  RAIO options were later extended to
      be able to carry suboptions [RFC6925].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Applicability

   The mechanism described in this document is not universally
   applicable.  This is intended as a special-purpose mechanism that
   will be implemented where nodes that must obtain IPv4 configuration
   information using DHCPv4 in specific environments exist and native
   DHCPv4 is not available.  This mechanism may be enabled using an
   administrative control, automatically or by other means that are
   beyond the scope of this document.

4.  Architecture overview

   The architecture described here addresses a typical use case, where a
   DHCP client's uplink supports IPv6 only and the Service Provider's
   network supports IPv6 and limited IPv4 services.  In this scenario,
   the client can only use the IPv6 network to access IPv4 services, so
   IPv4 services must be configured using IPv6 as the underlying network
   protocol.

   Although the purpose of this document is to address the problem of
   communication between the DHCPv4 client and the DHCPv4 server, the
   mechanism that it describes does not restrict the transported
   messages types to DHCPv4 only.  As the DHCPv4 message is a special
   type of BOOTP message, BOOTP messages [RFC0951] MAY also be
   transported using the same mechanism.

   DHCP clients may be running on CPE devices, end hosts, or any other
   device that supports the DHCP-client function.  This document uses
   the CPE as an example for describing the mechanism.  This does not
   preclude any end host, or other device requiring IPv4 configuration,
   from implementing DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 in the future.

   The basic mechanism for 4o6 is described in [RFC7341], where Figure 1
   describes the mechanisms applicability of [RFC7341].  The mechanism
   is described in details in section 5 of [RFC7341].

                  Figure 1: RFC7341 Architecture Overview

4.1.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 in the Relay Agent

   The current specifications for DHCPv6 Relay Agents such as LDRA
   [RFC6221] or L3RA [RFC8415] doesn't foresee the possibility to handle
   legacy DHCP, on the other hand this can be solved at the client as
   described in [RFC7341] when possible.

   The specification for DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] does only foresee
   the case where en- and decapsulation are accomplished at the client.

   This document proposes to extend the features of all DHCPv6 Relay
   Agents by the addition of DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 feature, thus providing
   the en- and decapsulation at the Relay Agent rather than at the
   client.

   The current document applies when the CPE cannot be upgraded, so that
   4o6 cannot be implemented as strictly described in [RFC7341], still
   providing the same features as [RFC7341].  The Architecture for the
   resulting case is shown in Figure 2.

                     '-----------'             '-----------'

          Figure 2: Architecture Overview with legacy DHCP client

   In Figure 2 the implementation of the encapsulation and decapsulation
   described in [RFC7341] is accomplished in the Relay Agent whereas the
   DHCP Client does not require any change.

   All prerequisites and configuration that in section 5 of [RFC7341]
   apply to the DHCP client shall be applied to the 4o6RA instead.

4.2.  Considerations on the network design

   The 4o6RA mechanism described in the current document puts some
   requirements on the network design when comparing with the 4o6
   solution described at [RFC7341].  In order to make 4o6RA behave
   properly, the L2 network connecting CPEs shall not allow DHCP traffic
   to reach any DHCP server.  Furthermore, at least one 4o6RA shall be
   reachable in that L2 network so that the reacheability of a DHCP
   server is granted by means of 4o6RA.

4.3.  Considerations about L2 terminations at 4o6RA

   The 4o6RA mechanism implements a parser of DHCP messages, it shall be
   able taking care of all types of DHCP requests and replies.

4.4.  Topology considerations

   The DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] protocol specifications
   describe how addresses can be allocated to clients based on network
   topology information provided by the DHCP relay infrastructure.
   Address allocation decisions are integral to the allocation of
   addresses and prefixes in DHCP.  The argument is described in details
   in [RFC7969], here we want to guarantee that 4o6RA doesn't break any
   legacy capability when related to the use of topology.

   The scenario depicted in Figure 1 preserves the topology information
   as the DHCPv6 Relay Agent has the knowledge of the interface where
   the encapsulated DHCP request comes from.

   Moving 4o6 in the intermediate node rather than at the client breaks
   the topology propagation as 4o6 doesn't forward the interface
   information in the encapsulated message.

     +--------+-+         +-+---+---+    +--------+       +-+--------+
     |   DHCP   |         |  4o6    |    | DHCPv6 |       | DHCP 4o6 |

     |  on CPE  |         |         |    |        |       |          |
     +--------+-+         +-+---+---+    +--------+       +-+--------+
              |             |   |                           |
               '-----------'     '-------------------------'

                       Figure 3: Topology broken path

   As shown in Figure 3, the introduction of 4o6 at the edge of the IPv6
   network hides the L2 network from the DHCPv6 Relay agent.

   In order to preserve the topology information, it is recommended that
   the implementation of 4o6RA is combined with the implementation of
   LDRA [RFC6221] and that the implementation has a mechanism for LDRA
   to get interface information so that that they can be properly used
   for Interface-ID option as specified in section 5.3.2 of [RFC6221].
   The internal mechanisms of an implementation for transporting the
   interface information, their format and whether the interface
   information contains indication that a 4o6 RA agent is involved are
   out of the scope of the present document.

             |             |   | | interface ^               |
             |             |   | |   info    |               |
             |             |   |  '---------'                |
              '-----------'     '---------------------------'

                Figure 4: Topology path preserved with LDRA

   The recommended architecture is shown in Figure 4 where the whole
   Relay Agent is built up with cooperating 4o6 and LDRA, and interface
   information is propagated from 4o6 to LDRA with implementation
   specific mechanism.

4.5.  Considerations about 4o6RA deployment

   Deployment of 4o6RA depends on the network architecture and the scope
   of the node where the functionality is implemented.

   In a simple case, where the same node hosts 4o6RA and the DHCP4o6
   server, it may be just enough deploying 4o6RA itself, but in the
   general case and in order to preserve the network topology
   information, it is recommended the 4o6RA to be deployed in
   combination with a LDRA as shown in Figure 4.

4.6.  Considerations about DHCPv6 server

   The DHCPv6 server shall be compliant with 4o6 according to [RFC7341].

5.  Topology Discovery with 4o6RA

   The reason why Topology is important is well described in [RFC7969],
   among the motivation there's the possibility to provide a dedicated
   configuration based on where and how the CPE is connected to the
   network.  The [RFC7969] also describes how Topology information is
   made available at the DHCP Server in IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

   Besides the cases where Topology is used directly at the DHCP Server,
   we also consider cases where the Topology is used by a third agent
   that queries the DHCP Server later than in the DHCP configuration
   phase.  In this case, the agent receives the IP address information
   of the CPE and then queries the DHCP server using that IP address for
   obtaining the Topology information.

5.1.  IPv6 Clients using DHCPv6

   If the network is fully IPv6 enabled, DHCPv6 [RFC8415] can be used
   for Topology Discovery.  This solution uses DHCPv6 Relay Agent
   support in the server, whilst Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agents (LDRA)
   [RFC6221] are implemented in the L2 switches to inform DHCPv6 server
   about the L2 Topology.

5.2.  Clients with Dual Connectivity and 4o6 DHCP support

   If CPE needs an IPv4 address, it is connected to both IPv4 and IPv6
   and supports DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 [RFC7341], DHCPv6 [RFC8415] with a
   DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 compliant DHCP server can be used for Topology
   Discovery whereas DHCP is used still for IP address assignment.

   An example network with 4o6 compliant clients can be sketched as
   follows:

     +---------+
     |   4o6   |    P1 +-+------+     |                   |  +---------+
     |   CPE   +-------| | LDRA |     |  +----+------+    |  |  4o6    |
     +---------+       | +------+     |  |    | L3RA |    +--|  DHCP   |
                       |  L2    |     +--|    +------+    |  | Server  |
     +---------+    P2 | switch |     |  |           |    |  |         |
     |   4o6   +-------|        +-----|  |   Router  +----|  +---------+
     |   CPE   |       +--------+     |  +-----------+    |
     +---------+                      |                   |

             Figure 5: Layer 2 Topology discover with 4o6

   In Figure 5 the client supports [RFC7341] by implementing the 4o6
   encapsulation whereas the intermediate nodes implement LDRA [RFC6221]
   or L3RA [RFC8415] and finally the DHCP server is 4o6 DHCP capable
   [RFC7341].

5.3.  IPv4 Clients using 4o6RA

   If the CPE is IPv4 and is connected to a DHCP Server via the 4o6RA as
   shown in Figure 4, the DHCP 4o6 Server takes the aggregate
   information of the Topology for both IPv4 and IPv6 segments of the
   network.

   Ane example of such scenario is depicted here:

     +---------+
     |   4o6   |    P1 +-+------+     |                   |  +---------+
     |   CPE   +-------| | LDRA |     |  +----+------+    |  |  4o6    |
     +---------+       | +------+     |  |    | L3RA |    +--|  DHCP   |
                       |  L2    |     +--|    +------+    |  | Server  |
     +---------+       | switch |     |  |           |    |  +---------+
     | Legacy  |    P2 +------+ +-----|  |   Router  +----|
     |   CPE   +-------+ 4o6  | |     |  +-----------+    |  +---------+
     +---------+       +------+-+     |                   |  | Legacy  |
                                                          +--|  DHCP   |
                                                          |  | Server  |
                                                          |  +---------+

      Figure 6: Layer 2 architecture with 4o6 and legacy client

   If the DHCP 4o6 Server is built up with standalone DHCP and DHCPv6
   servers as shown in Figure 6, each of them knows only part of the
   Topology.  In such case a third agent willing to provide the
   configuration to CPE must be aware about the network and query both
   DHCP and DHCPv6 server in order to get the complete topology for
   configuration.

5.4.  Other configuration alternatives

   A third agent may also use other mechanism than DHCP for Topology
   Discovery such as LLDP, such mechanism requires implementation at the
   CPE and is not considered in this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   This documents applies 4o6 DHCP in a scenario where legacy IPv4
   clients are connected to 4o6 DHCP Relay Agent that performs the en-
   and decapsulation.  This document does not change anything else in
   the 4o6 DHCP specification and therefore the security consideration
   of [RFC7341] still apply.

   The legacy IPv4 client is not aware of this mechanism, however, even
   when 4o6 DHCP is used, the client does not have any control about the
   information provided by the Relay agent.  As such this change does
   not raise any additional security concerns.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix B.  Topology Discovery at the RAN

B.1.  Example Use Case: Switched Fronthaul

   This section describes a case where topology knowledge is needed for
   properly configuring the node.  The case comes from a change of
   topology by inserting a L2 switched network between the clients and
   the server.  One of the clients is responsible for the configuration
   of the other clients based on their topology.  Updating of the
   software on the clients is not possible.

B.1.1.  Topology Based Configuration of Radio Unit (RU)

   In Radio Access Networks (RANs) the Fronthaul is the network segment
   that connects Radio Units, the distributed radio elements in a mobile
   network, to other network elements.  The aggregation of Radio Unit
   devices (also known as Switched Fronthaul) hides the relationship
   between the Radio Units themselves and the physical ports where they
   are connected.  The Radio Units are the client hosts in the switched
   Fronthaul network and need to be configured based on their Topology.

             Figure 7: Layer 2 Switched Fronthaul Example

   Figure 7 shows multiple Radio Units that are connected to one
   Baseband Unit by means of a Layer 2 switched network.  The Baseband
   Unit is the central processing unit that handles baseband
   information.  A Baseband Unit is often placed rather centrally, while
   the Radio Units need to be distributed to be co-located with or near
   the antennas.  Traffic between Radio Units and Baseband Units is both
   IP-based and Layer-2-based and may pass a hierarchy of L2 switches.

   In order to properly address the Radio Unit, the Baseband Unit needs
   to associate the Radio Unit's MAC address to the L2 switch and
   respective port where the Radio Unit is connected.  To realize this
   device configuration in the Switched Fronthaul network, DHCPv6 can be
   used to discover the network Topology.

B.1.2.  Layer 2 Topology Discovery using 4o6 DHCP with legacy IPv4
        clients

   This section provides an example of how the topology discovery use
   case proposed in Appendix B.1 can be solved by having the DHCPv4 over
   DHCPv6 feature at the LDRA Agent.

   The new scenario, not described in [RFC7341], is shown in Figure 6.
   In such a scenario, the 4o6 encapsulation is implemented in the Relay
   Agent deployed in the edge L2 switch, or in general in the edge
   device providing connectivity to the legacy client.  In this case it
   is up to the Relay Agent to provide the full 4o6 DHCP set of
   functionality whereas the legacy client is not aware of being served
   via a 4o6 DHCP service.

   This extended LDRA with 4o6 Relay Agent (4o6RA), exchanges DHCP
   messages between clients and servers using the message formats
   established in [RFC8415].  To maintain interoperability with existing
   DHCP relays and servers, the message format is unchanged from
   [RFC8415].  The 4o6RA implements the same message types as a normal
   DHCPv6 Relay Agent Section 6 of [RFC7341].  They are: - Relay-Forward
   Messages - Relay-Reply Messages

   In this specification, the 4o6RA creates the DHCPV4-QUERY Message and
   encapsulates the DHCP request message received from the legacy DHCPv4
   client.

   When DHCPV4-RESPONSE Message is received by the 4o6 Relay Agent, it
   looks for the DHCPv4 Message option within this message.  If this
   option is not found, the DHCPv4-response message MUST be discarded.
   If the DHCPv4 Message option is present, the 4o6RA MUST extract the
   DHCPv4 message and forward the encapsulated DHCPv4-response to the
   legacy DHCPv4 client.

   Any Layer 2 Relay Agent receiving DHCPV4-QUERY or DHCPV4-RESPONSE
   messages will handle them as specified in Section 6 of [RFC6221].
