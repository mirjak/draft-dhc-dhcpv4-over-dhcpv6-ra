              DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 with Relay Agent Support
             draft-porfiri-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6-ra-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for networks with legacy
   IPv4-only clients to use services provided by DHCPv6 using DHCPv4-
   over-DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) in a Relay Agent.  RFC7341 specifies use of
   DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 in the client only.  This document specifies a
   RFC7341-based approach that allows DHCP 4o6 to be deployed as a Relay
   Agent (4o6RA) that implements the 4o6 DHCP en- and decapsulation if
   this is not possible at the client.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7341] describes a transport mechanism for carrying DHCPv4
   messages using the DHCPv6 protocol for the dynamic provisioning of
   IPv4 addresses and other DHCPv4 specific configuration parameters
   across IPv6-only networks.  The deployment of [RFC7341] requires
   implementation in all DHCP clients and at the DHCPv6 server.

   However, if the client only supports IPv4 and cannot easily be
   replaced or updated due to a number of technical or business reasons,
   this approach does not work.

   Similarly, the specifications for DHCPv6 Relay Agents such as LDRA
   [RFC6221] or L3RA [RFC8415] do not foresee the possibility to handle
   legacy DHCP, other than implementing 4o6 in client.

   This document specifies an [RFC7341]-based solution that can be
   implemented in intermediate nodes such as L2 switches or routers,
   without putting any requirements on clients.  No new protocols or
   extensions are needed, instead this document specifies an amendment
   to [RFC7341] that allows a Relay Agent to perform the 4o6 DHCP en-
   and decapsultion instead of the client.

3.  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Relay Agent (4o6RA)

   This document assume an network, where IPv4-only clients are
   connected to an uplink network that supports IPv6 only and limited
   IPv4 services.

   To address such a network setup, this document proposes to extend
   DHCPv6 Relay Agents with DHCPv4 over DHCPv6, as shown in Figure 1.

          Figure 1: Architecture Overview with legacy DHCP client

   This document specifies the encapsulation and decapsulation described
   in [RFC7341] to be performed in the Relay Agent whereas the DHCP
   Client does not require any change.  In this case it is up to the
   Relay Agent to provide the full 4o6 DHCP set of functionality whereas
   the legacy client is not aware of being served via a 4o6 DHCP
   service.  All prerequisites and configuration that to the DHCP client
   in Section 5 of [RFC7341] apply shall be applied to the 4o6RA
   instead.

   To maintain interoperability with existing DHCP relays and servers,
   the message format is unchanged from [RFC8415].  The 4o6RA implements
   the same message types as a normal DHCPv6 Relay Agent Section 6 of
   [RFC7341].

   In this specification, the 4o6RA creates the DHCPV4-QUERY Message and
   encapsulates the DHCP request message received from the legacy DHCPv4
   client.

   When DHCPV4-RESPONSE Message is received by the 4o6 Relay Agent, it
   looks for the DHCPv4 Message option within this message.  If this
   option is not found, the DHCPv4-response message MUST be discarded.
   If the DHCPv4 Message option is present, the 4o6RA MUST extract the
   DHCPv4 message and forward the encapsulated DHCPv4-response to the
   legacy DHCPv4 client.

   Any Layer 2 Relay Agent receiving DHCPV4-QUERY or DHCPV4-RESPONSE
   messages will handle them as specified in Section 6 of [RFC6221].

   The DHCPv6 server must be compliant with 4o6 according to [RFC7341].
   No additional requirements on DHCPv6 server are set by this
   specification.

4.  Using 4o6RA for Topology Discovery

   In some networks the configuration of a client host may depend on the
   topology.  However, when a new client host gets connected to the
   network, it may be unaware of the topology and respectively how it
   has to be configured.

   The DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] protocol specifications
   describe how addresses can be allocated to clients based on network
   topology information provided by the DHCP relay infrastructure.

   In IPv6 networks, Topology discover can be realized using DHCPv6
   Relay Agents [RFC6221] that insert relay agent options in DHCPv6
   message exchanges in order to identify the client-facing interfaces,
   e.g. using the Serial Number or other hardcoded information.  Then, a
   reference host that is responsible for providing configuration to the
   client host can obtain topology information from the DHCP server.

   Address allocation decisions are integral to the allocation of
   addresses and prefixes in DHCP.  The argument is described in details
   in [RFC7969], here we want to guarantee that 4o6RA does not break any
   legacy capability when related to the use of topology.

   In the scenario described in [RFC7341] the DHCPv6 Relay Agent knows
   the interface where the encapsulated DHCP request is received.

   Moving 4o6 in the intermediate node rather than at the client breaks
   the topology propagation as 4o6RA-only does not provide any interface
   information in the encapsulated message.

              | L2 Network  |   |        IPv6 Network       |
     +--------+-+         +-+---+---+    +--------+       +-+--------+
     |  DHCPv4  |         |  4o6    |    | DHCPv6 |       | DHCP 4o6 |

               '-----------'     '-------------------------'

                       Figure 2: Topology broken path

   As shown in Figure 2, the introduction of 4o6 at the edge of the IPv6
   network hides the L2 network from the DHCPv6 RA.

   In order to preserve the topology information, it is recommended that
   the implementation of 4o6RA is combined with the implementation of
   LDRA [RFC6221] and that the implementation has a mechanism for LDRA
   to get interface information that can be used for the Interface-ID
   option, as specified in Section 5.3.2 of [RFC6221].  The internal
   mechanisms to exchange interface information, their format and
   whether the interface information contains an indication that a 4o6RA
   is involved are out of the scope for this document.

                  .-----------.     .---------------------------.
                 | L2 Network  |   |          IPv6 Network       |
        +--------+-+         +-+---+--+---------+      +----------+
        |  DHCPv4  |         |  4o6   |  LDRA   |      | DHCP 4o6 |
        |  Client  +---------+  RA    + RFC6221 +------+  Server  |
        |          |         |        |         |      |          |
        +--------+-+         +-+---+--+---------+      +----------+
                 |             |   |                             |
                  '-----------'     '---------------------------'

                Figure 3: Topology path preserved with LDRA

   The assumed architecture is shown in Figure 3 where the whole RA is
   built up with cooperating 4o6RA and LDRA, and an internal interface
   to propagated topology information from 4o6RA to LDRA.

   In a simple case, where the same node hosts teh 4o6RA and the DHCP4o6
   server, it might be enough to only use 4o6RA, as shown in Figure 4.

                           .-----------.
                          | L2 Network  |

                 |   DHCP   |         |  4o6   | DHCP 4o6 |
                 |  Client  +---------+  RA    +  Server  |
                 |  on CPE  |         |        |          |
                 +--------+-+         +-+------+----------+
                          |             |
                           '-----------'

5.  Deployment Considerations

   As the client is not aware of the 4o6RA, the network deployment needs
   to ensure that all DHCPv4 broad- and unicast messages from the client
   are routed over the 4o6RA.  This can e.g. be achieved by placing the
   4o6RA in a cetral position that can observe all traffic from the
   clients or use of address translation with the 4o6RA address for
   unicast messages.

6.  Security Considerations

   This documents applies 4o6 DHCP in a scenario where legacy IPv4
   clients are connected to 4o6 DHCP Relay Agent that performs the en-
   and decapsulation.  This document does not change anything else in
   the 4o6 DHCP specification and therefore the security consideration
   of [RFC7341] still apply.

   The mechanism described differs from [RFC7341] as the DHCP client
   actually sends and receveis DHCP messages, whereas in [RFC7341] it
   only sends DHCPv6 messages.  This makes it possible that DHCP
   messages could reach a DHCP server without using the 4o6RA.  While
   this can cause errornous states in both the client and DHCP server
   and potentially even lead to misconfigrations that impact
   reachability, this is not seen as a security concern rather than a
   deloyment error.

   More generally, the legacy IPv4 client is not aware of this
   mechanism, however, even when 4o6 DHCP is used, the client does not
   have any control about the information provided by the Relay agent.
   As such this change does not raise any additional security concerns.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Example Use Case: Topology Discovery for IPv4-only Radio
             Unit in the RAN Switched Fronthaul

   In Radio Access Networks (RANs) the Fronthaul is the network segment
   that connects Radio Units, the distributed radio elements in a mobile
   network, to other network elements.  The aggregation of Radio Unit
   devices (also known as Switched Fronthaul) hides the relationship
   between the Radio Units themselves and the physical ports where they
   are connected.  The Radio Units are the client hosts in the switched
   Fronthaul network and need to be configured based on their Topology.

   information.  A Baseband Unit is often placed rather centrally, while
   the Radio Units need to be distributed to be co-located with or near
   the antennas.  Traffic between Radio Units and Baseband Units is both
   IP-based and Layer-2-based and may pass a hierarchy of L2 switches.

   In order to properly address the Radio Unit, the Baseband Unit needs
   to associate the Radio Unit's MAC address to the L2 switch and
   respective port where the Radio Unit is connected.  To realize this
   device configuration in the Switched Fronthaul network, DHCPv6 can be
   used to discover the network Topology.

   With the L2 switched network between the clients and the server, one
   of the clients is responsible for the configuration of the other
   clients based on their topology.  Updating of the software on the
   clients is not possible often not possible and clients may be
   IPv4-only.
