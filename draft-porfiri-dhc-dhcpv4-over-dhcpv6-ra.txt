              DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 with Relay Agent Support
             draft-porfiri-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6-ra-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a general mechanism for networks with legacy
   IPv4-only clients to use services provided by DHCPv6 DHCPv4-over-
   DHCPv6 (DHCP 4o6) like for instance discovering information about
   network Topology.  To address this scenario, this document specifies
   a RFC7341-based approach that allows DHCP 4o6 to be deployed as a
   Relay Agent (4o6RA) where 4o6 DHCP en- and decapsulation will be
   implemented even when this is not possible at the client.

1.  Introduction

   As the migration towards IPv6 continues, IPv6-only networks will
   become more prevalent.  In such networks, IPv4 connectivity will
   continue to be provided as a service over IPv6-only networks.  In
   addition to provisioning IPv4 addresses for clients of this service,
   other IPv4 configuration parameters may also be needed (e.g.,
   addresses of IPv4-only services).

   The transport mechanism for carrying DHCPv4 messages using the DHCPv6
   protocol is described in [RFC7341] for the dynamic provisioning of
   IPv4 addresses and other DHCPv4 specific configuration parameters
   across IPv6-only networks However, the deployment of [RFC7341]
   requires implementation in all DHCP clients and at the DHCPv6 server,
   as shown in Figure 1.  In some cases, updating the clients may be not
   feasible due to a number of technical or business reasons.

                  Figure 1: RFC7341 Architecture Overview

   Similarly, the specifications for DHCPv6 Relay Agents such as LDRA
   [RFC6221] or L3RA [RFC8415] do not foresee the possibility to handle
   legacy DHCP, other than implementing 4o6 in client.

   This document specifies an [RFC7341]-based solution that can be
   implemented in intermediate nodes such as L2 switches or routers,
   without putting any requirement on clients.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The following terms and acronyms are used in this document:

   *  CPE: Customer Premises Equipment (also known as Customer Provided
      Equipment), which provides access for devices connected to a Local
      Area Network (LAN), typically at the customer's site/home, to the
      Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) network.

   *  DHCP 4o6 client (or client): A DHCP client supporting both the
      DHCPv6 protocol [RFC3315] as well as the DHCPv4 over DHCPv6
      protocol described in this document.  Such a client is capable of
      requesting IPv6 configuration using DHCPv6 and IPv4 configuration
      using DHCPv4 over DHCPv6.

   *  DHCP 4o6 server (or server): A DHCP server that is capable of
      processing DHCPv4 packets encapsulated in the DHCPv4 Message
      option (defined below).

   *  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 (or 4o6): The architecture, the procedures and
      the protocols described in the DHCPv4-over-DHCPv6 document
      [RFC7341].

   *  DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Relay Agent (or 4o6RA): The 4o6 Relay Agent is
      the part of an LDRA implementing 4o6

   *  DHCP Relay Agent (or RA):

      This is a concept in all of the protocols, BOOTP [RFC0951]
      [RFC1542], DHCPv4 [RFC2131] [RFC2132], and DHCPv6 [RFC8415],
      although the details differ between the protocols.

   *  Lightweight DHCPv6 Relay Agent (or LDRA):

      This is an extension of the original DHCPv6 Relay Agent mechanism,
      to support also Layer 2 devices performing a Relay Agent function
      [RFC6221].

   *  LLDP: Link Layer Discovery Protocol

   *  Relay Agent Information Option (or RAIO):

      This is a DHCP option defined in [RFC3046].  Also commonly
      referred to as "Option 82".  RAIO options were later extended to
      be able to carry suboptions [RFC6925].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Architecture overview

   This document assume an architecture, where a DHCP client's uplink
   network supports IPv6 only and the Service Provider's network
   supports IPv6 and limited IPv4 services.  In this scenario, the
   client can only use the IPv6 network to access IPv4 services, so IPv4
   services must be configured using IPv6 as the underlying network
   protocol.

   DHCP clients may be running on CPE devices, end hosts, or any other
   device that supports the DHCP-client function.  This document uses
   the CPE as an example for describing the mechanism.  This does not
   preclude any end host, or other device requiring IPv4 configuration,
   from implementing DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 in the future.

   The current document applies when the CPE cannot be upgraded, so that
   4o6 cannot be implemented as specified in [RFC7341]

   To address such a network setup, this document proposes to extend the
   features of all DHCPv6 Relay Agents by the addition of DHCPv4 over
   DHCPv6 feature, thus providing the en- and decapsulation at the Relay
   Agent rather than at the client, as shown in Figure 2.

          Figure 2: Architecture Overview with legacy DHCP client

   This document specifes the encapsulation and decapsulation described
   in [RFC7341] to be performed in the Relay Agent whereas the DHCP
   Client does not require any change.  In this case it is up to the
   Relay Agent to provide the full 4o6 DHCP set of functionality whereas
   the legacy client is not aware of being served via a 4o6 DHCP
   service.  All prerequisites and configuration that in section 5 of
   [RFC7341] apply to the DHCP client shall be applied to the 4o6RA
   instead.

   This extended 4o6 Relay Agent (4o6RA) exchanges DHCP messages between
   clients and servers using the message formats established in
   [RFC8415].  To maintain interoperability with existing DHCP relays
   and servers, the message format is unchanged from [RFC8415].  The
   4o6RA implements the same message types as a normal DHCPv6 Relay
   Agent Section 6 of [RFC7341].

   In this specification, the 4o6RA creates the DHCPV4-QUERY Message and
   encapsulates the DHCP request message received from the legacy DHCPv4
   client.

   When DHCPV4-RESPONSE Message is received by the 4o6 Relay Agent, it
   looks for the DHCPv4 Message option within this message.  If this
   option is not found, the DHCPv4-response message MUST be discarded.
   If the DHCPv4 Message option is present, the 4o6RA MUST extract the
   DHCPv4 message and forward the encapsulated DHCPv4-response to the
   legacy DHCPv4 client.

   Any Layer 2 Relay Agent receiving DHCPV4-QUERY or DHCPV4-RESPONSE
   messages will handle them as specified in Section 6 of [RFC6221].

   The DHCPv6 server must be compliant with 4o6 according to [RFC7341].
   No additional requirements on DHCPv6 server are needed by this
   specification.

4.  Deployment Considerations

4.1.  Reachability

   The L2 network connecting CPEs shall not allow DHCP traffic to reach
   any DHCP server directly.  Furthermore, at least one 4o6RA shall be
   reachable in that L2 network so that the reacheability of a DHCP
   server is granted by means of 4o6RA.

4.2.  Topology Discovery

   The DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] protocol specifications
   describe how addresses can be allocated to clients based on network
   topology information provided by the DHCP relay infrastructure.
   Address allocation decisions are integral to the allocation of
   addresses and prefixes in DHCP.  The argument is described in details
   in [RFC7969], here we want to guarantee that 4o6RA doesn't break any
   legacy capability when related to the use of topology.

   The scenario depicted in Figure 1 preserves the topology information
   as the DHCPv6 Relay Agent has the knowledge of the interface where
   the encapsulated DHCP request comes from.

   Moving 4o6 in the intermediate node rather than at the client breaks
   the topology propagation as 4o6 doesn't forward the interface
   information in the encapsulated message.

               .-----------.     .-------------------------.
              | L2 Network  |   |        IPv6 Network       |
     +--------+-+         +-+---+---+    +--------+       +-+--------+
     |   DHCP   |         |  4o6    |    | DHCPv6 |       | DHCP 4o6 |
     |  Client  +---------+  RA     +----+   RA   +-------+  Server  |
     |  on CPE  |         |         |    |        |       |          |
     +--------+-+         +-+---+---+    +--------+       +-+--------+
              |             |   |                           |
               '-----------'     '-------------------------'

                       Figure 3: Topology broken path

   As shown in Figure 3, the introduction of 4o6 at the edge of the IPv6
   network hides the L2 network from the DHCPv6 Relay agent.

   In order to preserve the topology information, it is recommended that
   the implementation of 4o6RA is combined with the implementation of
   LDRA [RFC6221] and that the implementation has a mechanism for LDRA
   to get interface information so that that they can be properly used
   for Interface-ID option as specified in section 5.3.2 of [RFC6221].
   The internal mechanisms of an implementation for transporting the
   interface information, their format and whether the interface
   information contains indication that a 4o6 RA agent is involved are
   out of the scope for this document.

                  .-----------.     .---------------------------.
                 | L2 Network  |   |          IPv6 Network       |

        |   DHCP   |         |  4o6   |  LDRA   |      | DHCP 4o6 |
        |  Client  +---------+  RA    + RFC6221 +------+  Server  |
        |  on CPE  |         |        |         |      |          |
        +--------+-+         +-+---+--+---------+      +----------+

                 |             |   |                             |
                 |             |   |                             |
                  '-----------'     '---------------------------'

                Figure 4: Topology path preserved with LDRA

   The assumed architecture is shown in Figure 4 where the whole Relay
   Agent is built up with cooperating 4o6 and LDRA, and internal
   interface to propagated topology information from 4o6 to LDRA.

   In a simple case, where the same node hosts 4o6RA and the DHCP4o6
   server, it may be just enough deploying 4o6RA itself, as shown in
   Figure 5.

5.  Security Considerations

   This documents applies 4o6 DHCP in a scenario where legacy IPv4
   clients are connected to 4o6 DHCP Relay Agent that performs the en-
   and decapsulation.  This document does not change anything else in
   the 4o6 DHCP specification and therefore the security consideration
   of [RFC7341] still apply.

   The legacy IPv4 client is not aware of this mechanism, however, even
   when 4o6 DHCP is used, the client does not have any control about the
   information provided by the Relay agent.  As such this change does
   not raise any additional security concerns.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Example Use Case: Topology Discovery for IPv4-only Radio
             Unit in the RAN Switched Fronthaul

   In Radio Access Networks (RANs) the Fronthaul is the network segment
   that connects Radio Units, the distributed radio elements in a mobile
   network, to other network elements.  The aggregation of Radio Unit
   devices (also known as Switched Fronthaul) hides the relationship
   between the Radio Units themselves and the physical ports where they

   Fronthaul network and need to be configured based on their Topology.

             Figure 6: Layer 2 Switched Fronthaul Example

   Figure 6 shows multiple Radio Units that are connected to one
   Baseband Unit by means of a Layer 2 switched network.  The Baseband
   Unit is the central processing unit that handles baseband
   information.  A Baseband Unit is often placed rather centrally, while
   the Radio Units need to be distributed to be co-located with or near
   the antennas.  Traffic between Radio Units and Baseband Units is both
   IP-based and Layer-2-based and may pass a hierarchy of L2 switches.

   In order to properly address the Radio Unit, the Baseband Unit needs
   to associate the Radio Unit's MAC address to the L2 switch and
   respective port where the Radio Unit is connected.  To realize this
   device configuration in the Switched Fronthaul network, DHCPv6 can be
   used to discover the network Topology.

   With the L2 switched network between the clients and the server, one
   of the clients is responsible for the configuration of the other
   clients based on their topology.  Updating of the software on the
   clients is not possible often not possible and clients may be
   IPv4-only.
